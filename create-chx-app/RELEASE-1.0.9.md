# create-chx-app v1.0.9

## ðŸª¶ Lightweight Performance Boost

We've significantly reduced the package size and dependency count:

- **~60% fewer dependencies**: From 630+ packages to around 250-300 packages
- **Faster installation**: Cut npm install time from 2+ minutes to under 40 seconds
- **Smaller node_modules**: Reduced disk space usage by hundreds of MB

## ðŸŽ¯ Focus on Essentials

We've kept only the most important tools for modern React development:

- âœ… React and React DOM
- âœ… TypeScript with full type checking
- âœ… Vite for fast builds
- âœ… TailwindCSS for styling
- âœ… React Query for data fetching
- âœ… Zustand for state management
- âœ… React Hook Form + Zod
- âœ… Minimal testing setup

## ðŸ‘‹ Removed Optional Features

These features can be added manually if needed:

- Motion libraries (framer-motion, react-spring)
- Extra UI components
- Complex testing tools
- Compression plugins
- Animation libraries

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
# Create your project
npx create-chx-app my-app-name

# Get started faster than ever
cd my-app-name
npm i  # Now much quicker!
npm run dev
```

This template now follows the best practice of "start small, add what you need" rather than including everything by default.
