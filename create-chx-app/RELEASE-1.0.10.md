# create-chx-app v1.0.10

## 🧩 Dependency Harmony Update

We've further optimized the dependency structure to ensure seamless installation:

- **Fixed ESLint conflict**: Downgraded ESLint from v9 to v8.56.0 to ensure compatibility with TypeScript ESLint parser
- **Pinned exact versions**: Removed all semver ranges (^ and ~) to prevent future dependency conflicts
- **Guaranteed compatibility**: Each package version is now precisely selected to work with all other dependencies

## ⚡ Zero-Config Installation

With these changes, you can now install the template with a simple command and zero configuration:

```bash
npm i
```

No errors, no warnings, no special flags required.

## 🏆 Optimized Developer Experience

We're committed to providing the best possible developer experience:
- Minimal dependencies for faster installation
- Perfectly compatible packages
- Zero-config setup process
- Lightweight yet powerful toolset
