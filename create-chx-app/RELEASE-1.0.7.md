# create-chx-app v1.0.7

## ðŸ”„ Dependency Harmony Fix

We've resolved another dependency conflict for even better compatibility:

- **Updated Vitest**: Upgraded from v1.x to v2.0.1 to fix a conflict with vitest-mock-extended
- **Improved package compatibility**: Ensuring all testing tools work together properly

## âš¡ Smooth Installation

With these changes, you can simply run:

```bash
npm i
```

No error messages, no special flags, just a clean installation process!

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
# Create your project
npx create-chx-app my-app-name

# Get started in seconds
cd my-app-name
npm i
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Support

The template still provides excellent testing capabilities with the latest Vitest v2, making it easy to write and run tests for your components and utilities.
