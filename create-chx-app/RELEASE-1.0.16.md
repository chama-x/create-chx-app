## 🚀 CSS Animation Class Fixes

We've fixed several CSS animation class references that were causing potential issues:

- **Fixed missing animation references**: Replaced references to non-existent animations with correct ones
- **Fixed gradient-text-x class**: Now uses the shimmer animation directly instead of a non-existent animate-gradient class
- **Fixed float-element class**: Now uses direct animation reference instead of non-existent Tailwind class
- **Fixed slide-up animation**: Now references the correct animate-slide-in-up class

## 🔍 Technical Details

The template's CSS has been updated with these specific fixes:

```diff
.gradient-text-x {
-  @apply bg-gradient-to-r from-ch-accent-500 to-ch-accent-700 bg-clip-text text-transparent animate-gradient bg-[length:200%_auto];
+  @apply bg-gradient-to-r from-ch-accent-500 to-ch-accent-700 bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-[length:200%_auto];
+  animation: shimmer 2s linear infinite;
}

.float-element {
-  @apply animate-float;
+  animation: float 6s ease-in-out infinite;
}

.slide-up {
-  @apply animate-slide-up;
+  @apply animate-slide-in-up;
}
```

## ⚡ Proactive Error Prevention

This release takes a proactive approach by fixing potential issues before they cause problems:

- Eliminated inconsistencies between class references and available animations
- Ensured all animation classes reference existing and working animations
- Improved stability of CSS animations throughout the template

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

All animations now work properly across the application:

- ✅ Text gradient animations with proper shimmer effect
- ✅ Floating element animations with smooth transitions
- ✅ Sliding animations with consistent behavior
- ✅ No CSS console errors or warnings
